# SoccerStatsCrawler

> [!CAUTION]
> The website i was using `https://stats.betradar.com` is ${\color{red}not\ working}$ anymore. All this code wont work without the source website!

In 2015 i used [Betfair](https://www.betfair.com) to bet in European soccer games and i needed some games statistics to calculate custom probabilities. I found out that [Betfair](https://www.betfair.com) used [Betradar](https://betradar.com) services for the games info, schedules, etc. 

With that information, i made a python script to crawl the information i needed from `https://stats.betradar.com` (${\color{red}not\ working}$) and make all the calculations i needed in my server.
